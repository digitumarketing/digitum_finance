  # Fix RLS Policy Infinite Recursion

  1. Problem
    - Current policies on user_profiles table reference user_profiles within their conditions
    - This creates infinite recursion when trying to check permissions

  2. Solution
    - Drop existing problematic policies
    - Create new policies that avoid self-referencing
    - Use auth.uid() directly for user identification
    - Implement super admin check without circular reference

  3. Security
    - Users can read/update their own profiles
    - Super admin access handled through separate mechanism
    - Row level security maintained without recursion

-- Drop existing problematic policies

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admins can read all profiles" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own profile" ON user_profiles;

-- Create simple, non-recursive policies

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"

-- For super admin operations, we'll handle permissions in the application layer
-- This avoids the circular reference issue
